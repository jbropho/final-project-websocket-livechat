# Our approach
 The main aim of our project was to learn and use some new technologies. We debated writing the backend of our app (how the client will integrate with the server) in Scala
 which would be a new language for each of us to learn, however due to time constraints we decided to write the backend using node first, and then rewrite it in Scala.
 Our front end would be using react which again is a new technology for each of us. This was the first time most of us were also implementing any sort of WebSocket, with one of our group members having done a bit of work on it prior to the project.

 Before the project began we laid down ground rules to ensure maximum productivity during the duration of the project and to make sure people were kept clear about what is required from them.

 We aimed to achieve the MVP as quickly as possible to give us the greatest amount of time to build features on top of it. The main challenges in achieving the MVP were deciding which components were needed for the chatroom itself and how to write sufficient tests to make sure we were fully covered.

 Daily stand ups helped us to identify the short goals necessary in order for our MVP to take shape. Retros were not conducted daily as the workflow was very consistent throughout the project. However when it was clear discussion was needed, retros were used to evaluate the work that was done and to identify any improvements that could have been made along the way.
 While pair programming we made sure to regularly rotate our pairs to ensure everyone was clued into how each part of the app was functioning and to generate the opportunities for fresh ideas to be put forward.
