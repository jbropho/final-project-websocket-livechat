# Our approach
 The main aim of our project was to learn and use some new technologies. We debated writing the backend of our app (how the client will integrate with the server) in Scala
 which would be a new language for each of us to learn, however due to time constraints we decided to write the backend using node first, and then rewrite it in Scala.
 Our front end would be using react which again is a new technology for each of us. This was the first time most of us were also implementing any sort of WebSocket, with one of our group members having done a bit of work on it prior to the project.

 Before the project began we laid down ground rules to ensure maximum productivity during the duration of the project and to make sure people were kept clear about what is required from them.
