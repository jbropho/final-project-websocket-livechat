We would really love your contributions to the project and welcome them with open arms!!

If you would like to contribute, take a look at the list of issues or the README to see what currently needs to be worked on.
Please clone the latest master and make a descriptive branch name for your work.
Regularly make commits on the branch, the smaller the step, the better generally.
Once you have finished, push the branch to the repo and Travis will build, while waiting submit a pull request to the repo adding as much detail as you can to the PR request, a contributor will review it and merge it, and if not communicate anything that needs to be changed.

Please note, if you are suggesting new features to add - the code MUST be test driven - this is non negotiable
